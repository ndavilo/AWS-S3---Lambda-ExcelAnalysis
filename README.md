AWS S3 & Lambda Excel Analysis

This AWS Lambda function, powered by a CloudFormation template, automates Excel analysis on data stored in an S3 bucket. The script is designed to be triggered by S3 events, such as the upload of a new Excel file.

Features:

Automatic Trigger: Responds to S3 events, initiating analysis upon file upload.
Data Extraction: Retrieves Excel data from the specified S3 bucket and object key.
Data Analysis: Converts Excel data into a Pandas DataFrame, sorts it by transaction amount, and extracts the top 10 transactions.
Configuration: Easily adaptable for different column names by modifying the script.
Output: Saves the analyzed data back to the same S3 bucket, facilitating further access and analysis.
Requirements:

AWS account with necessary permissions.
Python environment with required libraries (boto3, pandas).
Usage:

Deploy the CloudFormation template to set up the necessary AWS resources.
Upload Excel files to the specified S3 bucket.
The Lambda function will automatically trigger, perform the analysis, and upload the result back to S3.
Feel free to customize and extend this solution based on your specific requirements.

Note: Ensure the Lambda function and S3 bucket are in the same AWS region for optimal performance.
